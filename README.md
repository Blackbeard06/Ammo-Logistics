# Ammo-Logistics


What does this mod do?

Ammo Logistics is a simple mod that adds bulk vanilla ammo. Loot them yourself or add (6) boxes of any of the same caliber round into a bigger box. This is a smaller version of the ammo cache feature from my mod: Blackbeard's Weapons [Build 41].



Notice!
I created this mod so that the weight of the ammo stash boxes are lighter than what they should be. If they are too heavy then the container holding the ammo stash box would be full and no more loot would spawn in the same container.

Compatibility
This mod should be compatible with any other mod.
This mod should work with Build 39, Build 40, Build 41 & Build 41.51

Bugs:
None at this time.
